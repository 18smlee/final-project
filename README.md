# final-project

This is it! The culmination of your procedural graphics experience this semester. For your final project, we'd like to give you the time and space to explore a topic of your choosing.

In order to begin choosing the topic of your final project, we ask you to write a design document:

Introduction
- What motivates your project?

Goal
- What do you intend to achieve with this project?

Inspiration/reference:
- You must have some form of reference material for your final project. Your reference may be a research paper, a blog post, some artwork, a video, another class at Penn, etc.  
- Include in your design doc links to and images of your reference material.

Specification:
- Outline the main features of your project.

Techniques:
- What are the main technical/algorithmic tools youâ€™ll be using? Give an overview, citing specific papers/articles.

Design:
- How will your program fit together? Make a simple free-body diagram illustrating the pieces.

Timeline:
- Create a week-by-week set of milestones for each person in your group. Make sure you explicitly outline what each group member's duties will be.

Along with your final project demo, you will submit a final report, in which you will update your original design doc as needed and add a few post-mortem items.
