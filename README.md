# final-project

This is it! The culmination of your procedural graphics experience this semester. For your final project, we'd like to give you the time and space to explore a topic of your choosing. To help structure your time, we're breaking down the project into 4 milestones

## Milestone 1: Project planning (due 11/15)
## Milestone 2: Implementation part 1 (due 11/22)
## Milestone 3: Implementation part 2 (due 11/29)
## Final submission (due 12/6)

In order to begin choosing the topic of your final project, we ask you to write a design document:

Introduction
- What motivates your project?

Goal
- What do you intend to achieve with this project?

Inspiration/reference:
- You must have some form of reference material for your final project. Your reference may be a research paper, a blog post, some artwork, a video, another class at Penn, etc.  
- Include in your design doc links to and images of your reference material.

Specification:
- Outline the main features of your project.

Techniques:
- What are the main technical/algorithmic tools youâ€™ll be using? Give an overview, citing specific papers/articles.

Design:
- How will your program fit together? Make a simple free-body diagram illustrating the pieces.

Timeline:
- Create a week-by-week set of milestones for each person in your group. Make sure you explicitly outline what each group member's duties will be.

Along with your final project demo, you will submit a final report, in which you will update your original design doc as needed and add a few post-mortem items.

## Suggestions

### Create a generator in Houdini

### A CLASSIC 4K DEMO
- In the spirit of the demo scene, create an animation that fits into a 4k executable that runs in real-time. Feel free to take inspiration from the many existing demos. Focus on efficiency and elegance in your implementation.
- Example: 
  - [cdak by Quite & orange](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCh3Q08HMfs&list=PLA5E2FF8E143DA58C)

### A FORGERY
Taking inspiration from a particular natural phenomenon or distinctive set of visuals, implement a detailed, procedural recreation of that aesthetic. This includes modeling, texturing and object placement within your scene. Does not need to be real-time. Focus on detail and visual accuracy in your implementation.
- Examples:
  - [Snail](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ld3Gz2)
  - [Journey](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ldlcRf)
  - [Big Hero 6 Wormhole](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-R-6AN2cWjwg/VTyIzIQSQfI/AAAAAAAABLA/GC0yzzz4wHw/s1600/big-hero-6-disneyscreencaps.com-10092.jpg)

### A GAME LEVEL
- Like generations of game makers before us, create a game which generates an navigable environment (eg. a roguelike dungeon, platforms) and some sort of goal or conflict (eg. enemy agents to avoid or items to collect). Must run in real-time. Aim to create an experience that will challenge players and vary noticeably in different playthroughs, whether that means complex dungeon generation, careful resource management or a sophisticated AI model. Focus on designing a system that will generate complex challenges and goals.
- Examples:
  - Spore
  - Dwarf Fortress
  - Minecraft
  - Rogue

### AN ANIMATED ENVIRONMENT / MUSIC VISUALIZER
- Create an environment full of interactive procedural animation. The goal of this project is to create an environment that feels responsive and alive. Whether or not animations are musically-driven, sound should be an important component. Focus on user interactions, motion design and experimental interfaces.
- Examples:
  - [Panoramical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBTTMNFXHTk)
  - [Bound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE37l6RvF-c)

### YOUR OWN PROPOSAL
- You are of course welcome to propose your own topic . Regardless of what you choose, you and your team must research your topic and relevant techniques and come up with a detailed plan of execution. You will meet with some subset of the procedural staff before starting implementation for approval.
