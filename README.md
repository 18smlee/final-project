# Procedural Flower Tool

#### Introduction
When I first started learning about proceduralism, I was always fascinated by the occurrences of proceduralism in nature such as fractal plants and flowers. Here’s a link to some cool instances of fractals in nature http://eeobcourseblogwolfestudents.blogspot.com/2014/12/qu.html 
In this project, I will explore how to create a tool that makes various blooming flowers in Houdini. 

#### Goal
I envision the final output of this project being an art directable flower tool, that allows the user to easily and quickly create beautiful flowers with high variance. I am also interested in learning more about Houdini’s features, specifically in animation and simulation. I hope to add in features such as customizable animations depending on the flower bloom and wind simulation. 

#### Inspiration/reference:
Here is a link to some visual inspiration of different types of flowers blooming in slow motion: https://youtu.be/CV2P-xsEiYE?t=1398

This may not be extremely relevant to the scope of this project, but I found a design simulation talk that looked really interesting. It may be something I can incorporate into the tool to make it more abstract and fantasy like in the future: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeuo5DjRsq0&ab_channel=Houdini

#### Specification:
1. Create a basic tool that generates a single flower procedurally
- Import a petal with a texture and rotate around center n number of times
- Add blooming animation that follows pattern from visual reference
2. Fine tune tool to add more variance and input controls
- Focus on getting a really nice render of one flower - will have to learn how to light a scene
3. Use flower tool to fill a bouquet of flowers or populate some organic scene


#### Techniques:
The technical aspect of this project will involve problem solving in how to recreate certain patterns and features of the flowers procedurally in Houdini. While some of the flowers have a relatively consistent shape radially, other flowers like orchids do not bloom directly from the center, and their petal shapes are a bit more irregular.

Creating a tool that gives the user flexibility to create flowers of all different petal shapes and blooming patterns will definitely be an interesting technical challenge!

Here is a great example of a similar tool made using Houdini: https://80.lv/articles/procedural-flower-tool-in-houdini/ 

#### Timeline:
Week 1: 
Create basic tool that generates a simple flower with basic animation
Week 2:
Fine tune tool to add more variance and increase complexity
Learn how to create a high quality render
Week 3:
Create final scene using tool with at least 5-6 different types of flowers and plants
Add finishing touches like wind simulation and dust particles
